**Project: Simple Blogging Platform**   
   
**Description:** Create a basic blogging platform where users can perform the following actions:
- **View Posts:** Display a list of blog posts with details such as title, content, and publication date.
- **Add Post:** Users should be able to add new blog posts by providing a title and content.
- **Edit Post:** Allow users to edit existing blog posts, modifying details such as title and content.
- **Delete Post:** Provide the functionality to delete blog posts.
 
**Technical Requirements:**     
**Backend (Spring Boot):**
- Use Spring Boot to create RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on blog posts.
- Create endpoints like /blogs for getting all blogs, /blogs/{id} for getting a specific blog, /blogs/create for creating a new blog, /blogs/update/{id} for updating a blog, and /blogs/delete/{id} for deleting a blog.
- Use database like MySQL or PostgreSQL to store blog post data.

**Frontend (AngularJS):**
- Develop a single-page application using AngularJS.
- Implement views for displaying a list of blog posts, an add/edit post form, and relevant user interfaces.
- Utilize AJAX to communicate with the backend APIs for fetching, adding, updating, and deleting blog posts.
- Implement basic form validation on the frontend.
